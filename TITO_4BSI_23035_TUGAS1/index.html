        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Fentanyl is a highly potent synthetic opioid, originally developed for medical pain management and widely used in treating severe or chronic pain, such as in cancer patients, post-surgical recovery, and intensive care. It is 50 to 100 times stronger than morphine and comes in various forms, including transdermal patches, injections, lozenges, and nasal sprays. As a Schedule II controlled substance, fentanyl is strictly regulated in medical settings due to its high risk of addiction and abuse. When prescribed, it provides powerful pain relief for patients who have developed tolerance to weaker opioids, making it a crucial medication for managing breakthrough pain and palliative care.

            However, fentanyl has also become a major driver of the opioid crisis, as illicitly manufactured versions have flooded the illegal drug market. It is often mixed with heroin, cocaine, and counterfeit prescription pills, leading to an alarming rise in opioid overdose deaths. Because of its extreme potency, even a tiny dose (as little as 2 mg) can be fatal, causing respiratory depression and unconsciousness within minutes. Public health officials have responded by increasing access to naloxone (Narcan), fentanyl test strips, and harm reduction programs, but its presence in the illegal drug supply continues to pose a severe global health threat.

        <h2 id="detailed-history">Detailed history</h2>
        <p>
            Fentanyl was first synthesized in 1960 by Dr. Paul Janssen, a Belgian pharmacologist and founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica. Dr. Janssen was searching for a stronger, faster-acting painkiller than morphine for use in medical settings, particularly for surgery and chronic pain management.

            His discovery of fentanyl marked a significant advancement in opioid pharmacology, as it was found to be 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.

        <h2 id="uses">Various uses of fentanyl</h2>
        <p>
            Fentanyl has several uses, both medical and illicit. Medically, it is used primarily for pain management in patients with severe or chronic pain, such as those undergoing cancer treatment, major surgery, or experiencing intense pain that does not respond to other opioids.
